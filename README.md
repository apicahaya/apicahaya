### Aloha! 👋

Hi my name is Agni and thanks for visiting my profile!
 
I'm close to finished my journey to be a World Class Developer @ Apple Developer Academy Cohort 4 in Indonesia and now I am pursuing my career as iOS Developer.
 
 🚀 Love to create project from the impactful one into the most ridiculous one.
 
 🎯 My goal's to be rich so I can buy a house at London near Emirates Stadium home of Arsenal FC lol
